# Text-classification-using-CNN

##    In the first project (CNN):
#### -We are going to use an imported data in the code just to learn how to use CNN with Text.
#### -I reached 88% score with just 2 epochs, but you can improve that, just try and take it easy.


##    In the second project (LSTM):
#### -We are going to use the bbc data in the code.
#### -I reached 91% score with just 20 epochs, you should try to improve the accuracy.

## -Good luck and have a bucket load of fun.
